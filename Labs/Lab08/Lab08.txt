a.
ra

ra is the register x1, and represents the 'Return address' register. This register would be used to hold an address for a caller to return back to after performing a subroutine.
b.
sp

sp is the register x2, and represents the 'Stack pointer' register. The saver for this register is the callee, and would be used to hold a pointer toward the stack in the CPU.
c.
Registers to hold parameters and return values for functions/procedures

a0/1 are the registers x10 & x11, and represent the 'Function arguments/ Return values' registers. These registers will hold parameters for set functions by the caller, as well as the return values.
d.
Registers to hold temporary values that are not preserved across different function calls

t3-t6 are the registers x28-x31, and represent the 'Temporaries' registers. These registers are meant to store temporary values that only would be actively used within a function call.
e.
Registers to hold values that are supposed to be preserved across different function calls.

s2-s11 are the registers x18-x27, and represent the 'Saved registers' registers. These registers hold values that are meant to be kept across different function calls.
