"Which struct is larger?"
The course_t struct is larger than the course_node_t struct. Each 72 bytes and 32 bytes respectively.
"Why these values?"
Course_t uses arrays of set sizes to hold information, giving them a larger memory imprint. Course_node_t, however, uses pointers to achieve the same task,which will store the memory addresses of each piece of information.
